# Multi-Object Grasping in the Plane

We consider the problem where multiple rigid convex polygonal objects rest in randomly placed positions and orientations on a planar surface visible from an overhead camera. The objective is to efficiently grasp and transport all objects into a bin. Specifically, we explore multi-object push-grasps where multiple objects are pushed together before the grasp can occur. We provide necessary conditions for multi-object push-grasps and apply these to filter inadmissible grasps in a novel multi-object grasp planner. We find that our planner is **19** times faster than a Mujoco simulator baseline. We also propose a picking algorithm that uses both single- and multi-object grasps to pick objects. In physical grasping experiments, compared to a single-object picking baseline, we find that the multi-object grasping system achieves **13.6\%** higher grasp success and is **59.9\%** faster.

Here, we provide the source code for our implementation.

## Getting started

	1. Create and activate a virtual environment (Code was tested with Ubuntu16.04 and python3.5)
		$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.5 venv ; source venv/bin/activate

	2. Install Physics Simulator Mujoco and dm_control in virtual env
		Follow instructions from Deepmind's dm_control project
		https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control.                                    

	3. Install other required python packages
		$  pip install -r requirements.txt

	4. Clone this repo/ Download and extract zip file.
		$ git clone https://github.com/wisdomagboh/multi-object-grasping.git

	5. Run setup.py to place custom domains into 'suite'
		$  python3.5 setup/setup.py


## Running experiments

	1. Simulation experiments
		$ bash run_exps.sh

	2. Generate simulation results
		$ python sim_plots_summary.py

	3. Physical picking experiments - launch two ros nodes.
		$ python3.5 rw_planner.py
		$ python3.5 arm_motion_generator.py 'grasp_type (MOG or SOG)' 'scene_number'

	4. Generate physical experimental results
		$ python rw_table_data.py
